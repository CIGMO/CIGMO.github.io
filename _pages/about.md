CIGMO develops a comprehensive numerical treatment of inequality-constrained problems in computational mechanics. 
It leverages broad a geometric framework known in different communities as Legendre functions, mirror maps, Hessian manifold, or information geometry.
It is a collaborative effort by researchers at Brown University, Georgia Tech, and the Courant Institute at New York University.
